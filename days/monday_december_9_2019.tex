The first session I made it to is Katja Hoffman's overview talk on RL.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives by Katja Hofmann}

RL is everywhere in our lives! We make decisions all the time: what socks to wear, what talks to attend, what to eat. But we also make these decisions {\it under uncertainty}. \\

Q: How can we describe how an agent interacts with an environment, collects experience, and learns from those experiences? \\

$\ra$ This is what RL is all about! Highly interdisciplinary---draws from neuroscience and psychology, but today will be focused on computational perspective. \\
